Cloud Migration and Metadata Management Case Study
--------------------------------------------------
Objective and Project Overview
-------------------------------

You were tasked with migrating 400 GB of data from on-premises to AWS, managing metadata for the transferred data, and setting up an automated system for ongoing data transfers and metadata extraction.

Vpn Setup :
A Vpn was set up to Establish a connection for transfering data between On-Premises to Aws.

Data Transfer Process
----------------------
Initial Bulk Data Transfer to AWS S3 :

Challenge: Migrating 400 GB of existing data from on-premises to AWS.
Solution:
DataSync Setup: You used AWS DataSync to move the bulk data to S3.
Lifecycle Management: Implemented lifecycle policies to move data from standard to Glacier after a specific period.
Metadata Extraction: Manually triggered a Lambda function to extract metadata and store it in RDS after the bulk transfer.

Ongoing Data Transfer and Management
------------------------------------
Ongoing Incremental Data Transfer to AWS EFS :

Challenge: Managing new data and its transfer to AWS.
Solution:
EFS Setup: EFS was set up on both the on-premises environment and AWS to facilitate the transfer of ongoing data using a cron job for every 6 hrs.

Metadata Extraction and Automation
----------------------------------
Lambda Functions for Metadata Extraction
Solution:
EFS Lambda: Set up to extract metadata from EFS every 6 hours and 15 minutes, storing it in RDS.
EventBridge Automation
The EventBridge rule for EFS triggered metadata extraction without manual intervention.

Security and Best Practices
---------------------------
AWS Secrets Manager
Database Credentials: Securely storing database credentials using AWS Secrets Manager rather than hardcoding them in Lambda functions.

Cost and Performance Optimization
---------------------------------
S3 Lifecycle Policies: Used to move older data to Glacier for cost savings.
EventBridge and Lambda: Automated metadata extraction, reducing manual effort and ensuring scalability.

Error Handling and Monitoring
-----------------------------
Lambda Failures: Implementing error handling, retry logic, and dead-letter queues (DLQ) for Lambda functions to ensure successful metadata extraction.
CloudWatch Monitoring: Integrating CloudWatch Logs for debugging and CloudWatch Alarms for monitoring Lambda performance.

Conclusion
-----------
Your case study demonstrates a well-structured approach to cloud migration and metadata management using AWS services. You leveraged automation, cost optimization, 
and security best practices to ensure a seamless migration and ongoing data management. 
By manually triggering the Lambda function for the initial bulk transfer and automating future operations, you efficiently handled both large datasets and ongoing data updates.
